            I am a graduate Mathematics student at
            <a href="https://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>. During the
            summer of 2025, I was a research intern in the Computing &
            Information Science Research Foundation at Sandia National
            Laboratories (Livermore, California), as part of the

              >Universities Research Association-Sandia Graduate Student Summer
              Fellowship</a
            >, where I worked on data-driven machine learning surrogate models 
            (data-driven closure models) and data assimilation. 
            I am a former research intern at the 2023 MIT Lincoln Laboratory
            Summer Research Program, where I worked on unsupervised machine learning under
            Group 39 of Division 3, as part of the
            <a

            >
            Fellowship Employer Sponsor Internship. In the summer of 2022, I was a
            participant at the

              >Summer@ICERM2022: Computational Combinatorics</a
            >
            REU Program at Brown University, where I researched parking
            functions and algebraic combinatorics under 
            <a 
              class="text-green-600 hover:underline"

            participated in the East Tennessee State Universtiy & University of
            Puerto Rico at Ponce REU Program in Algebraic Coding Theory,
            Probability and Combinatorics, where I researched
            algebraic-geometric error-correcting codes and linear
            error-correcting codes under Prof. Fernando Piñero from the 
            University of Puerto Rico at Ponce. 
            I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics at the 
            <a

              > University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus (UPRM)</a
            >, where I also worked as a research assistant in abstract algebra 
            and number theory under Prof. Reyes M. Ortiz Albino. 
            Some of my hobbies include origami, watching pop-culture related
            movies and shows, enjoying nature, and playing percussion
            instruments. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me
